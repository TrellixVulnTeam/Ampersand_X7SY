So, if you're measuring by fear people feel, you're more likely to find the source of that in the mainstream media than you will in religion.	2
Look at how scared everyone got over Ebola, a non issue for most westerners.	2
islam has some toxic components christianity no longer has	2
I probably am more likely to be killed by a muslim than a christian *because of their religion*.	2

Your stance relies on the assumption that religion has no influence on the actions of its followers beyond the superficial.	1
With this in mind, I think its safe to assume the truth is somewhere in between, with both the religion and the culture somehow influencing the unrest we see.	1
